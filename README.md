A research of Genetic Algorithm by `Phatdev`, `Le Thanh Phuc`. To apply to optimal problems in practice.

In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)).
